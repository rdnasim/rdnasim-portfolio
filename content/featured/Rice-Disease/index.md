Recent developments in deep learning based convolution neural networks (CNN) have greatly improved image classification accuracy. Being motivated by the success of CNN's in image classification, deep learning based approaches have been developed in this thesis for detecting diseases from several 8 classes of rice disease dataset. I achieve 70.33% accuracy on the training dataset and 66% accuracy on the test dataset, respectivel.
